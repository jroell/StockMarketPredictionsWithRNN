# Stock Market Predictions With RNN
The goal of this project was to predict stock market prices using a recurrent neural network. This project was inspired by the Standford paper "Financial Market Time Series Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks Armando Bernal, Sam Fok, Rohit Pidaparthi December 14, 2012". Using the Standford paper as a baseline, I was able to improve and beat the accuracy of their model using hyper parameter tuning of my rnn network.
